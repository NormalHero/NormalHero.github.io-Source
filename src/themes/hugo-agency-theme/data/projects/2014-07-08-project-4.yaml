description: This purpose of this console application is to scan a network and retrieve information about the devices that are currently connected to the network. This application allowed the IT managers at UCSB to monitor connected user devices, keep a history of devices in a database, and alert of any unauthorized devices connecting to the network. UI was not a concern as this console application was automated to run periodically from the command line.
