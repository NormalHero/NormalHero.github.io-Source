description: ETrade's complete redesign of their account activation system that was over a decade old. Old C Tuxedo webservices were migrated to our new in-house Java webservices framework. New batch jobs were created to take care of picking up new customer account activations requests periodically. The redesign created a more fluid and intuitive process for the customers while at the same time updating our codebase to a newer tech stack.
